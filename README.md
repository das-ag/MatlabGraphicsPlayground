# MatlabGraphicsPlayground

## How to Run?
One of this project's requirements is to be able to run the file from the browser. While MATLAB's web compiler would be a great option to create a web app, it requires the developer to create the app using the drag-and-drop Web Designer, which does not allow me to create the application programatically, and host the application. For a project of this scope I am opting for the user to run the script in MATLAB online. 

To run the application online, you may open the local file [src/threeDapp.m](src/threeDapp.m) in MATLAB Online. For ease of use I have also placed this script in MATLAB drive, accessible using this [share link](https://drive.matlab.com/sharing/4a1085e5-0515-4f2d-9677-01e2021c8df2).
